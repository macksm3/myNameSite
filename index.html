          <p>It all started with music in high school. As base player in band, I also endeavored to take care of the tech
            stuff, like sound and lights. I designed built a road worthy light show because, you know, every band needs
            lights to play on stage. From there I went on to building speaker systems, installing car audio, recording
            bands/music, and playing base/guitar.</p>
          <p>I landed at TweeterEtc in retail sales at a time when audio and video were just coming together. The audio CD
            technology was introduced to the world while I was there. The iPod did not exist, neither did the cell phone.
            Then I discovered photography! I spent a considerable amount of time as a working pro doing portraits and
            youth sports teams. Owned a photography franchise called "The Sports Section" and was doing that when auto
            focus lenses first came out. Learning to shoot with auto focus was challenging at first but soon became second
            nature. Digital Photography started slowly with Kodak developing the first high quality digital capture system
            that attached to a Nikon camera. Getting a computer capable of displaying high quality photography was VERY
            expensive as personal computers were just starting to be a thing.</p>
          <p>As I realized "production line photography" was not what I wanted to do for the rest of my life I made a move
            to high tech, home automation first, then commercial A/V. With home automation products and a small PC, I
            created a christmas tree lighting system that had 4 dimmers that each had a different color light string. The
            tree would fade from color to color in a sort of random patern and it was the absolute best christmas
            decoration I have ever had. I was building and fixing computers and networks for small businesses, again self
            employed but not really making enough money. I was able to score a gig with a small commercial integration
            company where I did autoCAD system documentation and control system programming. Control System Programming
            became a life long career that ended abruptly, last year. So now I start over, able to provide consulting
            services, problem solving with a vast array of knowledge and a wealth of experience able to tackle anything
            you can throw at me.</p>

          <p><span>Crestron control in hospital operating rooms is a growing trend, and producing a reusable, configurable
              control program that does not require compilation for each project with just a configuration file is key. As
              the dedicated hardware product comes online, the need for support spaces outside the OR develops, with
              large, complex, multi-processor projects that require thousands of programming hours to complete. Crestron
              programming used to create showpiece systems that attract new customers nationwide including the attention
              of another major player in the integrated OR business, Olympus. Also created protocol translators that
              convert commands for given device that may have gone end of life to different model device where standard
              release product does not contain capability for that device (i.e. lighting controllers and audio
              processors)</span></p>
